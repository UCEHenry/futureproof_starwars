                        <h1>Children of the Jedi</h1>
                        <p>Han Solo and Princess Leia learn of the now-abandoned Jedi stronghold on the planet of
                            Belsavis from Drub McKumb and travel there, only to discover a political conspiracy
                            involving a Force-adept, members of the Ancient Houses and the Emperor's Hand who is able to
                            change the programming of droids and mechanicals. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, two Jedi
                            students (Nichos and Cray), and a myriad selection of alien life-forms along with a former
                            stormtrooper are abducted aboard the sinister Eye of Palpatine, impossibly reactivated after
                            thirty years. Fighting the effects of massive indoctrination, injury, and the cold
                            manipulation by the ship's artificial intelligence and its horrific security measures, Luke
                            discovers the Eye is bound for the destruction of Belsavis. Racing against time and
                            exhaustion he struggles to rescue his companions; who are being held hostage as the Will has
                            decided they are Rebel Saboteurs, find a way to transport all the ship's prisoners back to
                            their home worlds, and find a way to destroy the super-weapon. He makes an unexpected ally
                            in the form of Callista Ming, the brave Jedi who sacrificed her life to stop the ship thirty
                            years before, and now exists as a fading spirit in the gunnery computers. Tenderness grows
                            between them, but time is running out, and the destruction of the Eye will mean the final
                            loss of Callista forever.

                            Beyond all hope, Callista is revived as a human when Cray chooses to die and be reunited
                            with her dead lover Nichos and offers her body to the former Jedi. But everything has to be
                            paid for, Callista loses her Jedi powers. Their love and trials continue in Darksaber and
                            The Planet of Twilight.</p>

                        <h1>Darksaber</h1>
                        <p>While searching Jabba the Hutt's palace on Tatooine, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo learn that
                            the Hutts are planning to build another superweapon. Meanwhile, in the Hoth Asteroid Belt,
                            Durga the Hutt is planning a diplomatic mission to Coruscant, where he will secretly obtain
                            the plans for the Death Star superlaser for Bevel Lemelisk, the Death Star's designer.
                            Skywalker and Solo reveal their discoveries, but not before Durga's subordinates steal the
                            plans from the Imperial Palace. In order to find out the location of the superweapon, the
                            New Republic launches a covert operation to Nal Hutta, disguised as a diplomatic summit.
                            Back at the Hoth asteroid belt, Lemelisk starts construction on the cylindrical superlaser,
                            which he calls the "Darksaber" for its shape is similar to the hilt of a lightsaber.

                            Luke and Callista embark on a journey to help Callista regain her Force powers. They
                            discover that Callista can only tap into the Dark Side of the Force after they were attacked
                            by some strange flying creatures on Dagobah. Their journey continues to the Hoth system
                            where they encounter a group of stranded refugees. The group is attacked by a pack of
                            wampas, led by the same wampa Luke dismembered several years ago. The refugees are killed in
                            the attack, Luke and Callista try to escape only to find their ship wrecked. They lift off,
                            but have little power and become stranded in the asteroid belt surrounding Hoth.

                            They are rescued by Han and Leia, who just returned from the successful mission on Nal
                            Hutta. However, Luke and Callista's rescue is mainly thanks to the Republic fleet, who
                            arrived to launch Crix Madine and his squad to locate the Darksaber reported to be under
                            construction in the region. While Madine succeeds in relaying the location to the fleet, he
                            is captured and killed by Durga. However, Durga's triumph is short-lived when the Republic
                            fleet spots the Darksaber and begins pursuit. The Darksaber attempts to fire its superlaser
                            and make an escape, but the weapon fails and the ship is destroyed by two large asteroids.

                            Meanwhile, Admiral Daala succeeds in uniting the remains of the Empire in the core systems.
                            With the help of Pellaeon, she plans a strike force against a series of New Republic
                            targets, including the Jedi academy on Yavin 4. They also attack Khomm, where Jedi trainees
                            Kyp Durron and Dorsk 81 are visiting. Furious, the pair of Jedi spy on Daala's fleet and
                            succeed in warning the academy of the attack. Using the powers of the Force, the Jedi
                            trainees back at Yavin 4 manage to hold off Daala's forces until New Republic reinforcements
                            arrive. Daala is forced to retreat when her Super Star Destroyer, the Knight Hammer, is
                            destroyed. After the failed attack, Daala transfers control over the Imperial forces to
                            Pellaeon. Meanwhile, Callista decides to temporarily leave Luke and venture on a journey to
                            regain her powers. Luke is heartbroken, but decides to move on and continue to build the
                            Jedi academy.</p>

                        <p>The story takes place about a year after the previous book on Nam Chorios, a backwater world
                            in the Outer Rim which infamously was the center of the Death Seed Plague centuries ago. It
                            is now home to a fanatic religious cult which is plotting to use a new weapon system of
                            quasi-intelligent crystals as unstoppable, unmanned starfighters to attack the New Republic.
                            Leia unofficially goes on a trip to meet with Seti Ashgad, the leader of the Rationalist
                            Party.

                            Luke Skywalker is there after receiving a message from Callista. Luke's ship is shot down
                            and Leia is kidnapped by the ancient and corrupt Beldorion the Hutt.

                            After a series of adventures the two escape and end the political conspiracy between the
                            Rationalists and the New Republic.</p>
